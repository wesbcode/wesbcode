- Hi, Iâ€™m @wesbcode
- I worked for Blizzard Entertainment on World of Warcraft as Graphics Programmer, Gameplay Programmer and Tools Programmer. I also shipped another MMO where I wrote a patcher for the game right before launch so our publisher wouldn't cancel the game. Not ideal. ðŸ˜Š
- C/C++ is my bread and butter, but I've dipped a toe in Rust. I don't write insane templated code in C++ anymore. Simple is best. I also have written a decent number of C# apps. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning DirectX 12 and OpenXR.
- I'm interested in remote coding opportunities in C++ and C#.
